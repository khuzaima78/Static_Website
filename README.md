# Responsive Web Design with Animations

<!-- ### Created a web design inspired by [Pixelgrade's](https://pixelgrade.com/) -> [WordPress Theme](https://pixelgrade.com/themes/restaurants/rosa2/): -->
**1.  A Static website using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. <br>
2. A Dynamic website using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, AJAX and JSON**.

#### In the Dynamic Website I've added a Feedback Form with validations and server side programming i.e. PHP and MySQL for collecting user data.
 
### Here are some of the looks of the *STATIC* website:
